# Bugs 
    - onion skin for frames doesint work
    - move dot out of range resets color to red
    - changing the canvas size is weird 

# MVP
- add tabs for colors/animation/layers

- previous 2 color switch
    - just as a quick reference, does no effect the pallete

 - colors used in pallette  
        - when changing color in pallete, update all instances of that color in all layers

- box selection tools
    - stretch with side grab 
    - rotate with corner grab
    - copy selection 
    - move selection to new layer new layer 

- wand selection 

- laso selection

- lighten/darken tool 

- import/export 
    - import project file
    - export selected frame 
        - all
    - export selected layer
        - all 
    - upscale/downscale exports
    - save as project file 
    - recommend local saved projects
    - delete local saved projects   

- rig system 
    - bones arnt visible in final render 
    - one bone per layer 
    - pivit point for the layer becomes the start of the bone 
    - choose parent bone when creating new bone 
    - copy and paste layer copies bones aswell 
    - when animating bones, use index of bone to figure out which bones should move
    - parent bones move child bones on other layers 
  
# Stretch 
- light source tool, creates highlights and shadows for you 
- export as gif (just to easily share on different media)
- circle tool
- mesh deformation tool (points, weights)
- color pallette recommendations

- redo button
- tweening 
    - choose how many frames to create 
    - button to generate tweening frames based on "move" tool or "bone" tool
