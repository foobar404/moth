# Doing
- (Austin)(Urgent)(Medium) When I was using many different layers, and some were hidden, I went back to the layer tabs and all the other layers were blank

# TODO
- (Easy) Join multiple similer tool into one iterface
- (Easy) The zoom scroll zooms to the center, not the cursor
- (Easy) gif export not working 
- (Easy) switching tabs resets state
- (Easy) I don't know what to call this glitch but set your brush to 10, put it in the center of the canvas, and slowly move your cursor to the side of the canvas (update: some of the selection tools do similar when moving selections)
- (Easy) Switching frames turns on any layers that were switched to be hidden (only a problem for onion skin)
- (Easy) Saveable color palettes 
- (Easy) Exports are blurry 
- (Medium) saved projects should have a preview img
- (Medium) Importing other image types just donâ€™t do anything and then crashes
- (Medium) Importing some image types can crash the software
- (Medium) More brushes
- (Medium) Fill in for shapes
- (Hard) make selections standout
- (Hard) Ctrl-z undos brush strokes and last canvas resize {urgent} (update: this glitch only happens when actually typing in the changes, and only works when the change makes the value more than the base 32)
    - CTRL-Z undos and changes in text (title, color palette name, ect)
    - When you undo layer joins, the number of layers does not change, the layer just disappears.
    - Undo redo wont work with layers
- (Hard) Color picker dot is slow when changing the color 
- (Hard) Add blur / jumble tool
- (Hard) Add contour tool 
- (Austin) add console error watch system

    - bones arnt visible in final render 
    - one bone per layer 
    - pivit point for the layer becomes the start of the bone 
    - choose parent bone when creating new bone 
    - copy and paste layer copies bones aswell 
    - when animating bones, use index of bone to figure out which bones should move
    - parent bones move child bones on other layers 
- tweening 
    - generate tweening frame via AI  
    - choose how many frames to create 
    - button to generate tweening frames based on "move" tool or "bone" tool 
    - provide types of progression arcs

    - Color pallets that are premade
    - Option to create a color pallet from sprite
    - previous 2 color switch
    - color pallette recommendations 
    - recommend colors based on current pallete and AI 
    - recommend better color alternatives based on AI 
    - pallette 
        - when changing color in pallete, update all instances of that color in all layers 
        - import/paste and export/copy a color pallette 
        - import pallette from image 
            - limit pallette to x colors
            - start with most common colors
            - squash similer colors?
    - deleting a color from the pallette doesint effect layers
- non-destructive "Effects"    
    - color filter
    - outline effect        
    - The "sun" effect is a ball, that is placed somewhere on the canvas, and affects the colors of the sprites with a specific falloff
        - light source tool, creates highlights and shadows for you
