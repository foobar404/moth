- generate tweening frame via AI
- paste reference image url     
- rig system 
    - bones arnt visible in final render 
    - one bone per layer 
    - pivit point for the layer becomes the start of the bone 
    - choose parent bone when creating new bone 
    - copy and paste layer copies bones aswell 
    - when animating bones, use index of bone to figure out which bones should move
    - parent bones move child bones on other layers
